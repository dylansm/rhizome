> A user interface is like a joke—if you have to explain it, it's not that good.

I saw this in a post somewhere recently and immediately liked it. It's painful to watch someone interact with a design and not know how to achieve their goals. Instead of addressing the underlying layout or interface issues, designers—often due to the exigencies of time or budget—will instead label elements with the action they want people to know about.

<!--<DIV class="ctr image" style="width: 298px;">![][1]<P class="caption">First, ask why you wouldn't.</P></DIV>-->

![][1]{: width="149px"}  
Why wouldn't you?
{: class="caption ctr"}

When otherwise natural usage is obfuscated by design, there's likely a problem that labeling won't fix. In the above example, a full-bleed image carousel, with left/right arrows to navigate between images, appeared to cancel out vertical scrolling altogether.

We are everyday confronted by applications that challenge us to quickly decode the unfamiliar. The onus of making these interfaces intuitive should be, as much as possible, on the designer — not the person using them. The unfamiliar always carries a hidden cost, and the debt incurred can accumulate in seconds.

Guides and explanatory text can be helpful aids in understanding an application's terrain, particularly where there are multiple layers of interface depth. Labels that serve only to restore something that was never removed in the first place should be avoided.
