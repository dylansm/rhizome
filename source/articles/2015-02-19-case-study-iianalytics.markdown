When Jack Welch and Andrew Lightman met with me at [Owen Jones][2] to discuss the technical direction I had chosen for the new IIA website, I had several reservations. Here was a business whose core needs could be met with any of several CMS options, yet what I really wanted to pursue was Ruby on Rails or some other newer, sexy tech or language. Maybe that would bring something to this project that seemed to be missing for me. The apparent lack of portfolio suitable storytelling and imagery also seemed to be a knock against this project.

My initial biases were misguided, however. This is a portfolio piece because of the results. Nothing is better than having a happy customer who uses and benefits daily from a tool you build. In the end, the PHP-based CMS we worked with was right-sized and appropriate for the business, has proven reliable and scalable, and the site deserves to be showcased for that reason.
