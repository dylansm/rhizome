This was the first time I've tried to paint a guitar that I assembled. Sparkle paint is very difficult to handle. I went through a couple of spray guns and more than one can of Big Daddy Roth Rattlebomb paint.

The bridge is a [Mastery][2] Offset Bridge with Vibrato. The pickups are [Lindy Fralin][3] Hum-cancelling P-90's. Maple body and neck with rosewood fretboard.

The body, being a large slab of solid maple, makes this guitar quite heavy.
