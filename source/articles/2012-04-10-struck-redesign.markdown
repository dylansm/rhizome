Looking back at the Struck website redesign I worked on in 2012, it's interesting to compare favorably the refinements of today's site over the original. Much of the design has been cleaned up and, I think, improved. However, the core layout and lazy-loading functionality remains very much intact today, which feels like a testament to the underlying technology stack and implementation I chose as Technical Director. In addition to managing the project, I was responsible for the front-end development work on the site, and helping guide the Rails development.
