![Powderbird Website][1]

As Technical Director, Lead Programmer and Project Manager on the Powderbird website redesign with [Owen Jones & Partners][2], I had an opportunity to harness a powerful group of technologies to tell this adventure ski tour company's story with immersive photography, design and copy. I built a flexible CMS to allow for easy management of front-end design, assets and copy, as well as a back-end that handles ski tour reservations and user management.
