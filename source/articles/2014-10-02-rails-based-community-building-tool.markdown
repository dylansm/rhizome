*Features included*

This internal project with [Owen Jones][2] was one of the more fun projects I had the opportunity to work on with Adobe. I was able to apply a test-driven development approach to building an experience that was easy, fast and intuitive to use. The goal was to build a community platform where students could post videos, photos and written content, and be rated by program managers, who could communicate back through a custom messaging system. Sort of like Facebook with a scoring algorithm.
